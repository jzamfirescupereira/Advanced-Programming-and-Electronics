# Advanced-Programming-and-Electronics

I created a website with 3 examples of uploading videos onto webpages. Embedding, Embedding live video, and uploading raw HTML. The first problem I ran into was I tried running HTML on p5 and after realizing I needed a program like Sublime I still didnt switch the extension to HTML. After a quick tutorial from Kailen I was able to figure out how to apply all the notes I took down on video to web output and use some of the coding. With uploading the raw HTML i took a random video I had and moved it to a folder that I could find and used the name of the file in my code so that the website could retrieve the information from my computer. Then I added a player with code I found online, muted the video, and looped it. For the Youtube video it was as simple as copy and pasting the Embed Code. Lastly, for embedding live video I had to download other third party streaming interface. I used XSplitBroadcaster and Youtube simultaneously and took the embed code and put it into my website. Though the video stream was live, it was very laggy due to the internet connection


# Design Proposal

Summary

For the first time in the Interior Design department our 2 studio classes are combining to have a "double-final" on December 6th. I'm intrested in integrating all of the classes I'm taking this semseter into this project as well. Our assignment is to create a proposal to renovate for a 3 story building in Oakland and turn it into a Beauty/Design School. My concept is about connecting with the community and after seeing Kailen's presentation with Leaflet, I thought it would be intresting to turn my diagrams about the surrounding area into an interactive website or app the students attending could use to learn more about the community they are in and which areas are safer.

What can the user can interact with?

Ideally I would make a complete website using css and embedding (videos and the interactive map) and it would pair with the map. I would imagine there would be interactive screens throughout the building students could stop by and use.

COMPONENTS

Sublime (HTML coding)
Leaflet (Interactive Map)
Longitudal/Lagitudal Cooridinates for each icon
Diagrams/Work produced in my Studios
